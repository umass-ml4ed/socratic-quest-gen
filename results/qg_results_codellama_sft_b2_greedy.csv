Write a function `search(x: int, seq: List[int]) -> int` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.
## Example Cases:
```
search(5, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12]) => 1
search(-2, [-1, 57, 65]) => 0
search(0, [-120, 60, 78, 100]) => 1

On line 3, the function only checks if `x` is less than `seq[i]` and then returns the index `i` where `x` should be inserted. When `x` is in `seq` at position `i`, the function returns the next index `i + 1` instead of the current index `i`.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of `n` it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
User: For n = 1 or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
User: Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created, maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: Let's examine what happens in this case. Open the Python shell and type `[i for i in range(1)]`. What do you see?	<alt>Let's investigate this further. Open the Python shell and type `for i in range(1): print(i)`. Press `Enter` twice to execute. What do you see?
User: I see that `i` is not declared before the for loop is created. Yet the list comprehension `[i for i in range(1)]` returns `[0]`. So the issue is not with initializing `i` before the for loop.	<alt>I see a `[0]` in the list comprehension `[i for i in range(1)]`. So the issue is not with initializing `i` before the for loop but rather with the first value of `i` in the for loop. It is not 1 but 0 so `fact` will always be 0.
Assistant: Good. Let's take a closer look. What is the first value of `i` in the for loop?	<alt>Correct. What do you notice about the first value of `i` in the for loop?	<alt>Notice that the value of `i` in the first iteration of the for loop is 0. How do you think this affects the value of `fact`?
User: I see. The value of `i` in the first iteration of the for loop is 0. So `fact` will always be 0 because the first value of `fact = 1 * 0` is 0. Then, `fact` will be `0 * 1` in the second iteration of the for loop, and so on.
Assistant: Good! How can we fix this issue?	<alt>Good. Now, what does a correct factorial sequence look like for `n=4`?
User: I think we can fix this by changing the range of `i` to `range(1, n + 1)`.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(1, n + 1):6.                fact = fact * i7.        return fact</code>

<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

User: I can add a line that sets `i` to 1 before the for loop.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(n):7.                print(i)8.                fact = fact * i9.        return fact</code>
Assistant: Let’s see if that works. Can you try it for `n = 1`?	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 2` and see what happens.
User: Hm... It still returns 0.	<alt>It still returns 0. I think I need to change the for loop.
Assistant: Do you know why it still returns 0?	<alt>What do you think `range(n)` is doing to `i`?	<alt>Let’s look at the terminal output. What value is `i` on line 7 when being printed?
User: I think the problem is that `i` is still 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. It still prints 0. I think I can add an `if` statement to the for loop that checks if `i` is 0 and if so, sets it to 1.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(n):7.                if i == 0:8.                    i = 19.                  print(i)10.                fact = fact * i11.        return fact</code>	<alt>It still prints 0. I think I need to make a change in the for loop.	<alt>I don't know. Can you help?
Assistant: Let’s see if that works. Can you try it for `n = 1`?	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 2` and see what happens.	<alt>Did you try it for `n >=2`?
User: It works! Thank you for your help!
Assistant: Good. Can you try it for `n = 2` and `n = 3`?	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 3` and see what happens.	<alt>Did you try it for `n >=2`?
User: Hm... it's incorrect for both `n = 2` and `n = 3`. I think I need to multiply `fact` starting from 1, then 2, then 3 instead of what I'm doing now 1, then 1, then 2.

<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

</bug_desc>

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

﻿<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value `None`.


## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None

<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?
User: I did that and I think I see what the problem is. When the code encountered the value 3, instead of appending it to the list of previous values, it created a new list...<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] = [value]5.         print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])6.    return result7.8.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>
Assistant: Good observation. Can you now edit your code so that, if the key is already in the dictionary, it appends the new value for that key?	<alt>That is correct. Do you know how to append a new element to a list?
User: I did that, but when I run my code I get a `KeyError` message in line 4.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] += [value]5.         print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])6.    return result7.8.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>

<problem>
Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
my_func([(-78, 13),(-9, 2),(10, 2), (-78, 45), (-9, 2), (10, -78), (-9, 22)]) => {-78: [13, 45], -9: [2, 2, 22], 10: [2, -78]}

3.    for key, value in valList:
4.         result[key] = [value]
5.    return result
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function assigns a list of one element to each key in the dictionary `result` on line 4. Consequently, each list in the dictionary contains exactly one element instead of all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

<problem>
Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
my_func([(-78, 13),(-9, 2),(10, 2), (-78, 45), (-9, 2), (10, -78), (-9, 22)]) => {-78: [13, 45], -9: [2, 2, 22], 10: [2, -78]}

The function assigns a list of one element to each key in the dictionary `result` on line 4. Consequently, each list in the dictionary contains exactly one element instead of all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
my_func([(-78, 13),(-9, 2),(10, 2), (-78, 45), (-9, 2), (10, -78), (-9, 22)]) => {-78: [13, 45], -9: [2, 2, 22], 10: [2, -78]}

<bug_desc>
The function assigns a list of one element to each key in the dictionary `result` on line 4. Consequently, each list in the dictionary contains exactly one element instead of all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?

Assistant: Good. Now, at the next iteration, the tuple `(key, value)` will contain `(2, 5)`. What will `result[2]` become after executing the assignment in line 4?
User: Oh, now I see. The previous value will be overwritten and `result[2]` is assigned `[5]`. This explains why for every repeating key, only the last value that appears with it is stored in the dictionary. This means that instead of assignment I need to do something else to append. Let me see... Well, I edited the code to append the value, but now I get a `KeyError` message.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] += [value]5.    return result</code>

The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value None.

## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise(""rubbish"") => None
