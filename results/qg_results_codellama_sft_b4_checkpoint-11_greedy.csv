Write a function `search(x: int, seq: List[int]) -> int` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.
## Example Cases:
```
search(5, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12]) => 1
search(-2, [-1, 57, 65]) => 0
search(0, [-120, 60, 78, 100]) => 1
search(77, [-100, -50, 5, 44, 66, 76, 99]) => 6

On line 3, the function only checks if `x` is less than `seq[i]` and then returns the index `i` where `x` should be inserted. When `x` is in `seq` at position `i`, the function returns the next index `i + 1` instead of the current index `i`.

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:

factorial(-1) => 0

factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24

Great job! You have identified the issue with the code. Now, let's try to fix it. Can you think of a way to fix the code so that it returns the correct value for `n` when `n` is 1?

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
