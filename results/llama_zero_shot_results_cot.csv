<problem>
Write a function `search(x: int, seq: List[int]) -> int` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.
## Example Cases:
```
search(5, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12]) => 1
search(-2, [-1, 57, 65]) => 0
search(0, [-120, 60, 78, 100]) => 1
search(77, [-100, -50, 5, 44, 66, 76, 99]) => 6

3.    if x < seq[i]:
4.      return i
5.  return len(seq)
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the function only checks if `x` is less than `seq[i]` and then returns the index `i` where `x` should be inserted. When `x` is in `seq` at position `i`, the function returns the next index `i + 1` instead of the current index `i`.

<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```
</problem>

1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of `n` it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
User: For n = 1 or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
User: Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created, maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: Let's examine what happens in this case. Open the Python shell and type `[i for i in range(1)]`. What do you see?	<alt>Let's investigate this further. Open the Python shell and type `for i in range(1): print(i)`. Press `Enter` twice to execute. What do you see?
User: I see that `i` is not declared before the for loop is created. Yet the list comprehension `[i for i in range(1)]` returns `[0]`. So the issue is not with initializing `i` before the for loop.	<alt>I see a `[0]` in the list comprehension `[i for i in range(1)]`. So the issue is not with initializing `i` before the for loop but rather with the first value of `i` in the for loop. It is not 1 but 0 so `fact` will always be 0.
Assistant: Good. Let's take a closer look. What is the first value of `i` in the for loop?	<alt>Correct. What do you notice about the first value of `i` in the for loop?	<alt>Notice that the value of `i` in the first iteration of the for loop is 0. How do you think this affects the value of `fact`?
User: I see. The value of `i` in the first iteration of the for loop is 0. So `fact` will always be 0 because the first value of `fact = 1 * 0` is 0. Then, `fact` will be `0 * 1` in the second iteration of the for loop, and so on.

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

</bug_desc>

Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of n it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
User: For n = 1 or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
User: The first value assigned to `i` will be 1.	<alt>Aaah, I understand! The first value assigned to `i` will be 0, because `range` by default starts at 0.	<alt>Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: Are you sure about that? Can you verify that the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
User: OK, let me print its value at each iteration. I see, the first value is 0, not 1!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * i8.        return fact</code>	<alt>OK, let me check in the Python documentation what range does.

Assistant: How can you fix the code so that in the first iteration fact is multiplied with 1, not with 0?	<alt>Why do you think the first value is 0?

Assistant: How can you ensure that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied with 1?
User: I can add a line that sets `i` to 1 before the for loop.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(n):7.                print(i)8.                fact = fact * i9.        return fact</code>

The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value `None`.


## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""

﻿<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value `None`.


## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise(""rubbish"") => None
```
</problem>

1. def turn_clockwise(compass_point):
2.    if compass_point == ""N"":
3.        print (""E"")
4.    elif compass_point == ""E"":
5.        print (""S"")

9.        print (""N"")
10.    else:
11.        print (""None"")
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function prints the strings ""N"", ""E"", ""S"", ""W"", and ""None"". Consequently, the function returns `None` for all cases of `compass_point` instead of returning the appropriate strings.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace all the print statements `print (""E"")`, `print (""S"")`, `print (""W"")`, `print (""N"")`, `print(""None"")` with the return statements `return ""E""`, `return ""S""`, `return ""W""`, `return ""N""`, `return ""None""` on lines 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 respectively.

User: Hi! I have a problem. My code does not generate the right result and I cannot figure that out.
Assistant: Hi! Let's take a look at your code. Could you explain how your code works?	<alt>Hi! What makes you think that your program is not working properly?	<alt>Can you give me an example where your code does not return the correct result?	<alt>I see. Let’s run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")` then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?	<alt>I see. Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
User: Ok. My code gets the current `compass_point` and prints the next one.
Assistant: What do you see as your output in the terminal and what are you passing as `compass_point`?	<alt>What makes the result incorrect? Can you give me an example including what you are passing in as `compass_point` and what you observe in the terminal?
User: When I pass in `""N""` as `compass_point`. I see `""E""` printed in the terminal. That's strange since my output is printed correctly, but my program does not pass any of the tests.
Assistant: What does a unit test need from a function to ensure that the function works properly?	<alt>Ah. How did you determine whether your function is correct?	<alt>I see. Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?	<alt>Is printing the same as returning a value?	<alt>Say you want to store the output of your function into a variable, what would you need to do?	<alt>What do you think a function needs to pass along its output to say get stored in a variable?
User: It probably needs the value outputted by the function. My function outputs `""E""` in the terminal when I pass in `""N""` to it. The output is correct, so I am really confused.	<alt>I don't understand the question. Can you tell me more about unit tests?
Assistant: Correct. So would you be able to store the value outputted by the function into say a variable?	<alt>Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?	<alt>Is printing the same as returning a value?
User: Hypothetically yes. I should be able to store it in a variable. I have not tried though.

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1

What value would `i` need to be for `fact` to be equal to 0 after the for loop?	<alt>Let’s try it out on the terminal. Open the Python terminal using the `python` command. Then, type in a for loop similar to yours with `n` being 2. Then, in your for loop body, add in a print statement that prints `i`. What do you observe?	<alt>Let’s open the debugger. Step through your code until you reach line 6 for the first time. What do you notice about the value of `i`?
User: Sure … Aaah, I see, the first value is 0, not 1!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * i8.        return fact</code>	<alt>How do I do that?
Assistant: How can you fix the code so that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied with 1, not with 0?	<alt>Why do you think the first value is 0?	<alt>Good! Can you explain how that makes the function return 0 for n = 1 or larger?	<alt>Good! What can you do now to fix the issue?
User: I will multiply fact with `i + 1`. Let me do that … It works! Thank you for your help!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * i + 18.        return fact</code>	<alt>I can change it to `range(1, n + 1)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I can change it to `range(1, n)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I can change it to `range(n) + 1`, so that the first value is 0 + 1.	<alt>I don’t know, can you help?
Assistant: Can you also try it with `n = 2` and `n = 3`?	<alt>Do you think your code will work for all values of `n`, for example `n = 3`?
User: Hmm … it returns the correct value for `n = 2`, but for `n = 3` it returns 3, which is wrong.
Assistant: The code you edited in line 7 was supposed to multiply `fact` with `i + 1`. Does that code really multiply `fact` with `i + 1`?	<alt>Why is the code giving an incorrect answer for n = 3?	<alt>What should the output of factorial(3) be?
User: Aaaah, I see now, I should have used parentheses around `i + 1`. Let me do that … It works now! Thank you so much!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * (i + 1)8.        return fact</code>

Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?
User: I did that and I think I see what the problem is. When the code encountered the value 3, instead of appending it to the list of previous values, it created a new list...<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] = [value]5.         print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])6.    return result7.8.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>
Assistant: Good observation. Can you now edit your code so that, if the key is already in the dictionary, it appends the new value for that key?	<alt>That is correct. Do you know how to append a new element to a list?
User: I did that, but when I run my code I get a `KeyError` message in line 4.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] += [value]5.         print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])6.    return result7.8.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>
Assistant: Can you read in the Python documentation the section on the `dict` built-in type and see when `KeyError` is raised? Here is the link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict	<alt>Can you change your current code and in line 2 initialize `result = {1: 0}`, then run it on the same example and see if you notice anything different?	<alt>Do you know what happens when you try to get a value using a key that does not exist in the dictionary?
User: It is raised when `key` is not in the map. Oh, I see, I need an if to check if `key` is in the map. Let me try it... It works now!<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.        if key in result:5.            result[key] += [value]6.        else:7.            result[key] = [value]8.        print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])9.    return result10.11.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>	<alt>It is raised when `key` is not in the map.

`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?
User: In line 2, `result` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Then for every (key, value) pair in the input list, line 4 adds the value to the list stored for that key in the dictionary. Finally, line 5 returns the result.
Assistant: Are you sure that line 4 adds the `value` to the list for that key? Can you try running `d = {1: [7]}` then `d[1] = [5]` in the interpreter and observing what happens?	<alt>What exactly in line 4 makes you think that `[value]` is appended to `results[key]`?	<alt>Are you sure the value is added to the list? Line 4 shows an assignment statement. According to the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict, if `d` is a dictionary, then the assignment `d[k] = v` only sets `d[k] to have the value `v`.			
User: Ah, now I see. The old value `[7]` stored in the dictionary is overwritten by the new value `[5]`. Let me fix that so that it is appended to the current value... I did that, but now I get a `KeyError` message on line 4.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.        result[key] += [value]5.    return result</code>
Assistant: I will give you a hint. Can you try running `d = {}` then `d[2] = {7}` in your interpreter window and tell me what happens?	<alt>Do you know what happens when you try to get a value using a key that does not exist in the dictionary?	<alt>Can you run your code on the input list `[(1, 1)]` and see what happens, then change your current code and in line 2 initialize `result = {1: 0}`, run it on the same list and see if you notice anything different?
User: Ah, I see now. It raises a `KeyError` in the beginning when the dictionary does not have the key yet. I need to check first if `key` is in the dictionary. How do I do that?

<problem>
Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
my_func([(-78, 13),(-9, 2),(10, 2), (-78, 45), (-9, 2), (10, -78), (-9, 22)]) => {-78: [13, 45], -9: [2, 2, 22], 10: [2, -78]}
```

2.    result = {}
3.    for key, value in valList:
4.         result[key] = [value]
5.    return result
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function assigns a list of one element to each key in the dictionary `result` on line 4. Consequently, each list in the dictionary contains exactly one element instead of all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.  
</bug_desc>

```py
if key in result.keys():

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?
User: It will have value 2.
Assistant: So the value 1 that was in `a` is lost and overwritten with the new value '2'. Now, looking at the second test example, let's consider what happens in line 4 when the `(key, value)` tuple has value `(2, 7)`. What will be stored in `result[2]` after executing line 4?
User: `result[2]` will be equal to `[7]`.
Assistant: Good. Now, at the next iteration, the tuple `(key, value)` will contain `(2, 5)`. What will `result[2]` become after executing the assignment in line 4?
User: Oh, now I see. The previous value will be overwritten and `result[2]` is assigned `[5]`. This explains why for every repeating key, only the last value that appears with it is stored in the dictionary. This means that instead of assignment I need to do something else to append. Let me see... Well, I edited the code to append the value, but now I get a `KeyError` message.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] += [value]5.    return result</code>

<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value None.

## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise(""rubbish"") => None

<CONVERSATION>
User: Hi! I seem to be having some issues with this function I am trying to implement. It sometimes returns `None` instead of an output. 
Assistant: Can you walk me through how your function handles some simple examples? For example, `search(5, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12])`.	<alt>Do you notice a pattern with the cases that produce `None`?	<alt>When do you notice `None` as the output?	<alt>What inputs have you tried? When do you get `None`?	<alt>It seems that your function may be returning nothing in certain cases. Can you think of a case where this might happen?
User: For that example, I get an output of 1. I first iterate through the elements in the list and check when the 5 is less than or equal to the current element, which happens at index 1. 	<alt>This just gives an output of 1
Assistant: I see. What happens when you have a larger `x` value? Try `search(20, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12])`.	<alt>I see. What about when your `x` is not less than or equal to any elements?	<alt>That seems right. How do you deal with negative numbers and numbers greater than all the list elements?	<alt>Good. Is there a case where your function might not return anything?
User: For that, my code seems to return `None`. I use the same procedure and iterate through the list element. Oh, I see. Since 20 is greater than all the current list elements, I never get to the `return`
Socratic Guiding Assistant: 

NOTE: 
1. First generate a set of misconceptions that the user still has based on the Conversation so far. 
2. Your output MUST BE TWO PYTHON LISTS (enclosed in square bracketts) of misconcpetions and socratic guidance 
Example:
Output:
Misconceptions: ['misconception 1', 'misconception 2', 'misconception 3']
Guidance: ['write your first guidance here', 'your second guidance goes here', 'your third one goes here', 'and so on...']

Remeber to enclose the string in double quotes and not yse any unicode characters.

Output:","[""It looks like you just need to handle that other case then. What's a good answer to return when `x` is greater than all the existing elements?"", 'Where would you want to insert an element that is larger than all the current ones?', ""What's a good place to insert 20 in the example I gave you?""]","
Misconceptions: ['The function should always return the index of the first occurrence of `x`', 'The function should return the index of the last occurrence of `x`', 'The function should return `None` when `x` is not in the list']
Guidance: ['You are correct that the function should return the index of the first occurrence of `x`', 'However, the function should also handle the case where `x` is not in the list', 'You can use the `len` function to check the length of the list and return `None` when `x` is not in the list']"
