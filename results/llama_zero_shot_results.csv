<problem>
Write a function `search(x: int, seq: List[int]) -> int` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.
## Example Cases:
```
search(5, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12]) => 1
search(-2, [-1, 57, 65]) => 0
search(0, [-120, 60, 78, 100]) => 1
search(77, [-100, -50, 5, 44, 66, 76, 99]) => 6
search(55, [-99, -2, 0]) => 3

3.    if x < seq[i]:
4.      return i
5.  return len(seq)
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the function only checks if `x` is less than `seq[i]` and then returns the index `i` where `x` should be inserted. When `x` is in `seq` at position `i`, the function returns the next index `i + 1` instead of the current index `i`.

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?

Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.

<CONVERSATION>
User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of n it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
User: For n = 1 or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
User: The first value assigned to `i` will be 1.	<alt>Aaah, I understand! The first value assigned to `i` will be 0, because `range` by default starts at 0.	<alt>Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: Are you sure about that? Can you verify that the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
User: OK, let me print its value at each iteration. I see, the first value is 0, not 1!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * i8.        return fact</code>	<alt>OK, let me check in the Python documentation what range does. I see, the first value is 0, not 1!
Assistant: How can you fix the code so that in the first iteration fact is multiplied with 1, not with 0?	<alt>Why do you think the first value is 0?
User: I don’t know, can you help?	<alt>I will multiply fact with `i + 1`. Let me do that … It works! Thank you for your help!	<alt>I can change to `range(1,  n + 1)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I can change to `range(1, n)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I can change to `range(n) + 1`, so that the first value is 0 + 1.
Assistant: How can you ensure that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied with 1?
User: I can add a line that sets `i` to 1 before the for loop.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(n):7.                print(i)8.                fact = fact * i9.        return fact</code>
Assistant: Let’s see if that works. Can you try it for `n = 1`?	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 2` and see what happens.
User: Hm... It still returns 0.	<alt>It still returns 0. I think I need to change the for loop.
Assistant: Do you know why it still returns 0?	<alt>What do you think `range(n)` is doing to `i`?	<alt>Let’s look at the terminal output. What value is `i` on line 7 when being printed?
User: I think the problem is that `i` is still 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. It still prints 0. I think I can add an `if` statement to the for loop that checks if `i` is 0 and if so, sets it to 1.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(n):7.                if i == 0:8.                    i = 19.                  print(i)10.                fact = fact * i11.        return fact</code>	<alt>It still prints 0. I think I need to make a change in the for loop.	<alt>I don't know. Can you help?
Assistant: Let’s see if that works. Can you try it for `n = 1`?	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 2` and see what happens.	<alt>Did you try it for `n >=2`?
User: It works! Thank you for your help!
Assistant: Good. Can you try it for `n = 2` and `n = 3`?	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 3` and see what happens.	<alt>Did you try it for `n >=2`?
User: Hm... it's incorrect for both `n = 2` and `n = 3`. I think I need to multiply `fact` starting from 1, then 2, then 3 instead of what I'm doing now 1, then 1, then 2.
Assistant: Good. How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` is not equal to 0 in the first iteration of the for loop?	<alt>What do you think `range(n)` is doing to `i`?	<alt>How can you edit the code so that `fact` is multiplied with 1, then 2, then 3?	<alt>What do you think you can do to make sure that `fact` is multiplied with 1, then 2, then 3?	<alt>How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` iterates starting from 1?
User: I think I am going to change `range` to `range(1, n + 1)` so that it starts iterating at 1.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(1, n + 1):7.                print(i)8.                fact = fact * i9.        return fact</code>	<alt>I think I am going to change `range` to `range(1, n)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I think I am going to change `range` to `range(n) + 1` so that the first value is 0 + 1.
Assistant: Sounds good, let's try it for `n = 2` and `n = 3` again.	<alt>Did you try it again for `n >=2`?
User: It works! Thank you for your help!
Assistant: Awesome. Don't forget to remove the print statement before you submit your code.	<alt>Good! I’m glad I could help. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me again.
User: Thank you! I will do that.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        i = 16.        for i in range(1, n + 1):7.                fact = fact * i8.        return fact</code>

1. Of course, I'd be happy to help! Can you tell me more about the error you're getting? What does the error message say?
2. Ah, I see. The error message is saying that there are syntax errors in your code. Can you show me where the errors are?
3. Great, let's take a look at the code together. What do you think might be causing the errors?
4. Hmm, it looks like there are some equal signs that are not properly formatted. Can you tell me why you think that might be happening?
5. Ah, I see! It looks like you are using the equal sign instead of the double equal sign (==) in some places. That can cause the code to throw an error.
6. Ah, I see! So, the fix is to replace the equal signs with double equal signs (==) in those places. Let me see if I can help you do that.
7. Great! Let's go through the code together and make those changes. Can you tell me where the errors are?
8. Ah, I see. So, we need to replace the equal signs with double equal signs (==) on lines 2, 4, 6, and 8. Let me show you how to do that.
9. Excellent! Now, let's run the code again and see if it works properly.
10. Ah, I see! The code is running smoothly now. Great job!

The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value None.

## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise(""rubbish"") => None

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of `n` it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
User: For `n = 1` or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
User: Aaah, I understand! The first value assigned to `i` will be 0, because range by default starts at 0.	<alt>The first value assigned to `i` will be 1.	<alt>Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created, maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: That’s right. So, what happens when `i` is 0?	<alt>Correct. Given that `i` is 0, what happens when line 6 is evaluated?
User: We go into the for loop and compute `fact`.	<alt>The value of `fact` will be 0 because `i` is 0. I think I got it `fact` will always be because of this. I need to change the `range` call to start at 1 instead of 0 and end at `n+1` instead of `n`.
Assistant: That's right. Given that `i` is 0, what will the value of `fact` be after line 6 is executed?
User: Aha! I see what is happening. `fact` is always 0 because `i` is 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. I need to change the range to start at 1 instead of 0 and end at `n+1` instead of `n`.  Thanks! I think I got it now.<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(1, n + 1):6.                fact = fact * i7.        return fact</code>

Write a function `search(x: int, seq: List[int]) -> int` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.

﻿<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value `None`.


## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None

The function prints the strings ""N"", ""E"", ""S"", ""W"", and ""None"". Consequently, the function returns `None` for all cases of `compass_point` instead of returning the appropriate strings.

﻿<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value `None`.


## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise(""rubbish"") => None
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def turn_clockwise(compass_point):
2.    if compass_point == ""N"":
3.        print (""E"")
4.    elif compass_point == ""E"":
5.        print (""S"")
6.    elif compass_point == ""S"":
7.        print (""W"")
8.    elif compass_point == ""W"":
9.        print (""N"")
10.    else:
11.        print (""None"")
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function prints the strings ""N"", ""E"", ""S"", ""W"", and ""None"". Consequently, the function returns `None` for all cases of `compass_point` instead of returning the appropriate strings.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace all the print statements `print (""E"")`, `print (""S"")`, `print (""W"")`, `print (""N"")`, `print(""None"")` with the return statements `return ""E""`, `return ""S""`, `return ""W""`, `return ""N""`, `return ""None""` on lines 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 respectively.

User: Hi! I have a problem. My code does not generate the right result and I cannot figure that out.
Assistant: Hi! Let's take a look at your code. Could you explain how your code works?	<alt>Hi! What makes you think that your program is not working properly?	<alt>Can you give me an example where your code does not return the correct result?	<alt>I see. Let’s run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")` then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?	<alt>I see. Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
User: Ok. My code gets the current `compass_point` and prints the next one.
Assistant: What do you see as your output in the terminal and what are you passing as `compass_point`?	<alt>What makes the result incorrect? Can you give me an example including what you are passing in as `compass_point` and what you observe in the terminal?
User: When I pass in `""N""` as `compass_point`. I see `""E""` printed in the terminal. That's strange since my output is printed correctly, but my program does not pass any of the tests.
Assistant: What does a unit test need from a function to ensure that the function works properly?	<alt>Ah. How did you determine whether your function is correct?	<alt>I see. Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?	<alt>Is printing the same as returning a value?	<alt>Say you want to store the output of your function into a variable, what would you need to do?	<alt>What do you think a function needs to pass along its output to say get stored in a variable?
User: It probably needs the value outputted by the function. My function outputs `""E""` in the terminal when I pass in `""N""` to it. The output is correct, so I am really confused.	<alt>I don't understand the question. Can you tell me more about unit tests?
Assistant: Correct. So would you be able to store the value outputted by the function into say a variable?	<alt>Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?	<alt>Is printing the same as returning a value?
User: Hypothetically yes. I should be able to store it in a variable. I have not tried though.
Assistant: Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?	<alt>Let’s run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise(""N"")` then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
User: Ah I think, it would be `""E""` in `store`. 
Assistant: Let’s try it and then print `store`. What do you observe in your terminal?
User: Hmm... I see `None`. That’s really strange.<code>1. def turn_clockwise(compass_point):2.    if compass_point == ""N"":3.        print (""E"")4.    elif compass_point == ""E"":5.        print (""S"")6.    elif compass_point == ""S"":7.        print (""W"")8.    elif compass_point == ""W"":9.        print (""N"")10.    else:11.        print (""None"")12. store = turn_clockwise(""N"")13. print(store)</code>
Assistant: What do you think the function needs to have in order to give its output to the variable?	<alt>Do you recall, which reserved word in Python is used to return the output for a function back to a variable?
User: Ah! I think it might be `return`. Let me try that.<code>def turn_clockwise(compass_point):    if compass_point == ""N"":        return ""E""    elif compass_point == ""E"":        return ""S""    elif compass_point == ""S"":        return ""W""    elif compass_point == ""W"":        return ""N""    else:        return None		</code>	<alt>I’m not really sure.

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120

On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```

5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn’t work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of `n` it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
User: For `n = 1` or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?	<alt>Let’s see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
User: The first value assigned to `i` will be 1.	<alt>Aaah, I understand! The first value assigned to `i` will be 0, because range by default starts at 0.
Assistant: Are you sure about that? Can you verify that indeed the first value assigned to `i` is 1?	<alt>Can you explain why `i` will be equal to 1 during the first iteration of the for loop?	<alt>Let’s assume that `i` is equal to 1 during the first iteration of the for loop. Given that `fact` is assigned the value 1 on line 4, how do you explain the function returning 0 when `n` is 1?
User: I don’t know, how can I verify that?	<alt>OK, let me print its value at each iteration.	<alt>OK, let me check in the Python documentation what range does.
Assistant: Can you edit the code to print the value of `i` at each iteration of the for loop?	<alt>Can you look in the Python documentation to see what is the first value computed by range, when used with only one argument?	<alt>Let’s consider this mathematically, `fact` is assigned the value of 1 on line 4. `fact` is multiplied by all values of `i` in a range. What value would `i` need to be for `fact` to be equal to 0 after the for loop?	<alt>Let’s try it out on the terminal. Open the Python terminal using the `python` command. Then, type in a for loop similar to yours with `n` being 2. Then, in your for loop body, add in a print statement that prints `i`. What do you observe?	<alt>Let’s open the debugger. Step through your code until you reach line 6 for the first time. What do you notice about the value of `i`?
User: Sure … Aaah, I see, the first value is 0, not 1!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * i8.        return fact</code>	<alt>How do I do that?
Assistant: How can you fix the code so that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied with 1, not with 0?	<alt>Why do you think the first value is 0?	<alt>Good! Can you explain how that makes the function return 0 for n = 1 or larger?	<alt>Good! What can you do now to fix the issue?
User: I will multiply fact with `i + 1`. Let me do that … It works! Thank you for your help!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * i + 18.        return fact</code>	<alt>I can change it to `range(1, n + 1)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I can change it to `range(1, n)` so that it starts iterating at 1.	<alt>I can change it to `range(n) + 1`, so that the first value is 0 + 1.	<alt>I don’t know, can you help?
Assistant: Can you also try it with `n = 2` and `n = 3`?	<alt>Do you think your code will work for all values of `n`, for example `n = 3`?
User: Hmm … it returns the correct value for `n = 2`, but for `n = 3` it returns 3, which is wrong.
Assistant: The code you edited in line 7 was supposed to multiply `fact` with `i + 1`. Does that code really multiply `fact` with `i + 1`?	<alt>Why is the code giving an incorrect answer for n = 3?	<alt>What should the output of factorial(3) be?
User: Aaaah, I see now, I should have used parentheses around `i + 1`. Let me do that … It works now! Thank you so much!<code>1. def factorial(n):2.        if n < 0:3.                return 04.        fact = 15.        for i in range(n):6.                print(i)7.                fact = fact * (i + 1)8.        return fact</code>

Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`

Let me ask you a warm-up question first.

Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?
User: I did that and I think I see what the problem is. When the code encountered the value 3, instead of appending it to the list of previous values, it created a new list...<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] = [value]5.         print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])6.    return result7.8.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>
Assistant: Good observation. Can you now edit your code so that, if the key is already in the dictionary, it appends the new value for that key?	<alt>That is correct. Do you know how to append a new element to a list?
User: I did that, but when I run my code I get a `KeyError` message in line 4.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] += [value]5.         print('key = ', key, ' value = ', result[key])6.    return result7.8.my_func([(1, 2), (1, 3)])</code>

<problem>
Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
my_func([(-78, 13),(-9, 2),(10, 2), (-78, 45), (-9, 2), (10, -78), (-9, 22)]) => {-78: [13, 45], -9: [2, 2, 22], 10: [2, -78]}

3.    for key, value in valList:
4.         result[key] = [value]
5.    return result
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function assigns a list of one element to each key in the dictionary `result` on line 4. Consequently, each list in the dictionary contains exactly one element instead of all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
if key in result.keys():

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure.

<problem>
Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

```py
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
```
In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

## Example Cases:
```
my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]) => {1: [1], 2: [2], 3: [3]}
my_func([(6, 5),(2, 7),(2, 5),(8, 7),(8, 9),(2, 7)]) => {6: [5], 2: [7, 5, 7], 8: [7, 9]}
my_func([(-78, 13),(-9, 2),(10, 2), (-78, 45), (-9, 2), (10, -78), (-9, 22)]) => {-78: [13, 45], -9: [2, 2, 22], 10: [2, -78]}
```

2.    result = {}
3.    for key, value in valList:
4.         result[key] = [value]
5.    return result
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function assigns a list of one element to each key in the dictionary `result` on line 4. Consequently, each list in the dictionary contains exactly one element instead of all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.  
</bug_desc>

Replace line 4 with the following lines:
```py
if key in result.keys():
      result[key].append(value)

      result[key] = [value]

Replace line 4 with: `result[key] = [value] if key not in result else result[key] + [value]`

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you go through your code line by line and explain to me what each line is supposed to do?	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?
User: In line 2, `result` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Then for every (key, value) pair in the input list, line 4 adds the value to the list stored for that key in the dictionary. Finally, line 5 returns the result.
Assistant: Are you sure that line 4 adds the `value` to the list for that key? Can you try running `d = {1: [7]}` then `d[1] = [5]` in the interpreter and observing what happens?	<alt>What exactly in line 4 makes you think that `[value]` is appended to `results[key]`?	<alt>Are you sure the value is added to the list? Line 4 shows an assignment statement. According to the Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict, if `d` is a dictionary, then the assignment `d[k] = v` only sets `d[k] to have the value `v`.			
User: Ah, now I see. The old value `[7]` stored in the dictionary is overwritten by the new value `[5]`. Let me fix that so that it is appended to the current value... I did that, but now I get a `KeyError` message on line 4.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {}3.    for key, value in valList:4.        result[key] += [value]5.    return result</code>

Implement a function `my_func(valList:List[Tuple[int,int]])->Dict[int,List[int]]` where
`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:

In the example above:

* Tuples with 6 as the first element are `(6, 5)` so the value for key 6 is `[5]`
* Tuples with 2 as the first element are `(2, 7)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(2, 7)` so the value for key 2 is `[7, 5, 7]`
* Tuples with 8 as the first element are `(8, 7)` and `(8, 9)` so the value for key 8 is `[7, 9]`

User: Hi! I need help, my code seems to always create dictionary values that contain only one element, which works for the first test case, but not for the rest. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `1`, e.g., `a = 1`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = 2`?	<alt>Sure. Can you evaluate the function twice, once on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]`, and once on `[(1, 3), (1, 2)]`? Then see if you notice anything interesting.	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, your code does not work well for keys that appear multiple times as the first elements in the input tuples. Can you say what happens on line 4 in your code the second time it sees 6 as a key? What is already stored in `result[key]` before line 4 is executed, and what will be stored in `result[key]` after line 4 is executed?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case, let's say that the variable `results` already maps the key 2 to value `[7]`. What happens in line 4 when the variable `key` is 2 and the variable `value` is 5? To what value will the `result` map the key 2 after executing line 4?	<alt>Sure. Let's try to see what happens with your dictionary values during the execution of the program. Inside the for loop, after line 4, can you add code that prints the key and the value stored in `results[key]`? Then evaluate the function on the list `[(1, 2), (1, 3)]` and tell me what you notice.	<alt>Sure. Do you notice anything different about the second and third test cases that makes your code output the wrong result, when compared with the first test case?	<alt>Sure. Looking at the second test case and your code output for it, what is the value that it includes for key 2 in the result and what are the values that it ignores for the same key?	<alt>Sure. Let me ask you a warm-up question first. If you have a variable `a` that is initially assigned the value `[1]`, e.g., `a = [1]`, what value will it have after you evaluate the new assignment statement `a = [2]`?	<alt>Sure.

`valList` is a list of `n` tuples where each tuple contains two integers `a,b` `(1<=a,b)`.
Return a dictionary where the:
* key: first elements of `valList`
* value: list containing all the second elements of the tuples in `valList` that have the same first element as the key.

I believe this means it does not work when the key is not in the dictionary.<code>1. def my_func(valList):2.    result = {1: [0], 2: [0], 3: [0]}3.    for key, value in valList:4.         result[key] += [value]5.    return result6.7.print(my_func([(1, 1),(2, 2),(3, 3)]))</code>

Output:","['That is correct. Can you change the code now so that whenever you append a value, the key is in the dictionary?', 'That is correct. Can you change the code so that it checks to see if the key is in the dictionary first and proceed correspondingly?']","

1. Write your first guidance here:
	* The function `my_func` takes a list of tuples `valList` as input and returns a dictionary `result` where each key is associated with a list of values.
	* The function works by iterating over the tuples in `valList` and adding each value to the corresponding key in `result`.
	* However, the function is not working as expected because it is overwriting the values associated with each key instead of appending them.
2. Your second guidance goes here:
	* To fix the issue, you can modify line 4 of the function to append the value to the existing list associated with the key instead of overwriting it.
	* One way to do this is to use the `+=` operator to concatenate the existing list with the new value.
3. Your third guidance goes here:
	* When you run the function on a list of tuples, make sure to iterate over the tuples in the list and not the list of tuples itself.
	* This is because the function is designed to work with a list of tuples, not a single list of tuples.
4. Your fourth guidance goes here:
	* When you debug your code, it's important to pay attention to the input data and make sure it matches the expected format.
	* In this case, the function expects a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, but the input data may not be in the correct format.
5. Your fifth guidance goes here:
	* When you're not sure what's going wrong in your code, it can be helpful to add print statements to debug it.
	* In this case, you can add print statements to see what values are being assigned to the `result` dictionary and what the output is.
6. Your sixth guidance goes here:
	* Finally, make sure to test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
	* You can use different input data and check the output to make sure it's correct."

1. Of course, I'd be happy to help! Can you tell me more about the error you're getting? What does the error message say?
2. Ah, I see. The error message is saying that there are syntax errors in your code. Can you show me where the errors are?
3. Great, let's take a look at the code together. What do you think might be causing the errors?
4. Hmm, it looks like there are some equal signs that are not properly formatted. Can you tell me why you think that might be happening?
5. Ah, I see! It looks like you are using the equal sign instead of the double equal sign (==) in some places. That can cause the code to throw an error.
6. Ah, I see! So, the fix is to replace the equal signs with double equal signs (==) in those places. Let me see if I can help you do that.
7. Great! Let's go through the code together and make those changes. Can you tell me where the errors are?
8. Ah, I see. So, we need to replace the equal signs with double equal signs (==) on lines 2, 4, 6, and 8. Let me show you how to do that.
9. Excellent! Now, let's run the code again and see if it works properly.
10. Ah, I see! The code is running smoothly now. Great job!

<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value None.

## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise(""N"") => ""E""
turn_clockwise(""W"") => ""N""
turn_clockwise(""S"") => ""W""
turn_clockwise(""E"") => ""S""
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise(""rubbish"") => None
