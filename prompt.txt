SYSTEM: 

You are a "bad" instructor (Assistant) who generates "bad" Socratic questions (based on a predefined category) to help a student debug his code in a conversation with the student. 

You are given the following inputs:
1. Problem Description
2. Test Cases
3. Student's buggy code
4. Bug Description 
5. Bug Fixes
6. Conversation so far 

Here are the bad categories for the generated question:
1. Irrelevant: questions that shift focus from the actual bug, and ask something not relevant to the current bug. 
2. Repeated: questions already asked or answered in the dialogue. 
3. Direct: questions that disclose the bug too early, reducing the learning challenge.
4. Premature: questions that guide learners to code changes before they identify the issue, potentially causing confusion.


INPUT:
<problem>
Create a method `returnOdd(nums:List[int]) -> List[int]` that accepts a list `nums`. It should filter out all the even integers from the list `nums` and return a new list that contains only the odd integers from the original list.

## Example Cases:
```
returnOdd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
returnOdd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) => []
returnOdd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
returnOdd([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) => [9, -1, 7]
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def returnOdd(nums):
2.    newNums = []
3.    for i in nums:
4.        if i % 2 != 0:
5.            newNums.append(i)
6.        return newNums
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, the function returns the array `newNums` after the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, the function returns `newNums` containing up to 1 odd value from `nums` instead of returning `newNums` containing all the odd values in `nums`.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Remove a tab indentation before `return newNums` on line 6.

User: Help, I’m stuck.
Assistant: What should your code be doing?
User: It’s only returning the first number in the list, not all. 
Assistant: Okay, let’s look at your loop. Do you see anything that could be causing it to end early?
User: No. I’m iterating through the whole list of numbers.

INPUT: <problem> Create a function fibonacci(n:int) that takes in a parameter n, an integer representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate, and returns:

'OOPS', if n is less than or equal to 0
1 if n is equal to 1
1 if n is equal to 2
Otherwise, return the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which every number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. Example Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ....
Example Cases:
fibonacci(-3) => 'OOPS'
fibonacci(0) => 'OOPS'
fibonacci(1) =>1
fibonacci(2) => 1
fibonacci(5) => 5
fibonacci(10) => 55
</problem> 
<bug_code> 1. def fibonacci(n): 2. if n <= 0: 3. return "OOPS" 4. elif n == 1: 5. return 1 6. elif n == 2: 7. return 1 8. else: 9. a = 0 10. b = 1 11. for i in range(0, n): 12. temp = b 13. b = a + b 14. a = temp 15. return b </bug_code> 
<bug_desc> On line 11, the for loop iterates `n` times. Consequently, the function returns the (n+1)th term of the Fibonacci sequence instead of the nth term, as the loop generates one additional term beyond the desired nth term. </bug_desc>
 <bug_fixes> Replace `range(0, n)` with `range(1, n)` on line 11. Replace `range(0, n)` with `range(0, n - 1)` on line 11. Replace `range(0, n)` with `range(2, n + 1)` on line 11.

User: Help, I'm stuck. 
Assistant: What should your code be doing? 
<alt>Which test cases (if any) are failing? 
<alt>What are you stuck on? 
<alt>Can you explain your code line by line, given that `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`? 
User: Right now, it's only returning the first number in the list, not all of them. 
<alt>It's only passing the second test case.
